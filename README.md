# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Description:

Created this site using my html and css knowledge for a french oceanographer. This site is different to my previous projects because it is
responsive in that it will change the size and orientation of the elements based on the user's screen size. This will make this website available to all users.
